<h5 id="instructions-to-make-salmon-veggie-fritters-amp-poached-egg-with-a-dill-butter-sauce">Instructions to make Salmon, Veggie Fritters &amp; Poached Egg With A Dill Butter Sauce:</h5>
<ol>
<li>In a bowl mix together the fritter ingredients until a thick batter is formed and set aside.</li>
<li>Heat up two frying pans, one for the salmon the other for the fritters. Add a little oil to both. Also get a medium saucepan of salted water boiling ready to poach the eggs later.</li>
<li>Begin cooking the salmon skin side down. In the meantime begin batch cooking your fritters. You'll probably be able to cook 2-3 at a time. Gently spoon the batter into the hot pan and spread them into discs around 1.5cm thick. Once golden on one side, flip them over.</li>
<li>Flip the salmon fillets over once the skin side is crisp and season with salt and pepper. Continue to gently fry over a medium heat. Don't move the fish around in the pan too much, otherwise it may fall apart.</li>
<li>Once the fritters are cooked lay upon kitchen towel to soak up any excess oil.</li>
<li>Here's where you need to multitask a little. Once the pan of water is boiling turn the heat down a touch and add in the vinegar and stir through, then what I like to do is first crack each egg into a bowl, so I know the yolk hasn't broken then gently place them into the boiling water to poach. Time for exactly 2 minutes, then using a slotted spoon, carefully lift them out and place on kitchen towel to soak up the water. Season with a little salt and pepper.</li>
<li>Now to make the sauce. Turn the heat down a little on the salmon fillets and remove them and set aside, then add in the butter, capers and dill. Allow to melt down then remove the pan from the heat.</li>
<li>Now to serve up. Place 3 fritters on each plate, place the salmon next to them and pour over the butter sauce then carefully place the poached egg on top of the fritters. The yolk should be beautifully golden and runny once cut. Eat and enjoy! :)</li>
</ol>
<p>Mix rice, crab boil seasoning, mayonnaise, parsley and lemon juice. Let it cool and flake, or you can open a can of canned salmon. Transfer to a dish lined with paper towels to drain. I'm always on the hunt for fast and flavorful ways to add a veggie component to any meal, from tucking creamy avocado into homemade egg rolls to transforming cauliflower into tater-less tots. In a large frying pan, heat some oil on medium.</p>
