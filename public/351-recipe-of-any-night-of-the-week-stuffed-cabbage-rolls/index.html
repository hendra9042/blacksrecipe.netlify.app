<ol>
<li>For the sauce, heat olive oil in a saucepan. Add the onions and cook over medium heat until translucent. Add the tomatoes, brown gravy, brown sugar, vinegar, salt, and pepper. Simmer for 20 minutes.</li>
<li>Prepare the 1/2 cup of cooked rice and set aside. For the cabbage, fill a large pot with water (2&quot;) and bring to a light boil.</li>
<li>Cut around the cabbage head core and gently remove the outer leaves, yielding about 5-6 leaves per head. [Save the rest of the cabbage for other meals such as soup, corned beef, coleslaw, etc.]</li>
<li>Stack the cabbage leaves, immerse in the boiling water, and cover. After a few minutes, remove the leaves and set aside to cool.</li>
