<li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.</li>
<li>Warm the heavy cream until the chill is off. Don’t make it hot…you just don’t want it cold. It should be warm to the touch.</li>
<li>Once the rolls have risen, pour the heavy cream over the top of the rolls, allowing it to soak down in and around the rolls.</li>
<li>Bake at 375 degrees for 20-22 minutes, until the rolls are lightly golden brown and the center rolls are cooked through. Note…the time will vary based on how big the rolls are, what type of pan, how close the rolls are packed, etc. They could take up to 25-27 minutes. Check the rolls at 20 minutes. If they are getting too browned, cover loosely with foil for the remaining baking time.</li>
<li>While the rolls are cooling, prepare the cream cheese frosting.</li>
<li>In a large bowl, combine the softened cream cheese and butter using a hand mixer. Blend well.</li>
<li>Add in your favorite extract and the powdered sugar. Beat until combined.</li>
<li>Spread the frosting over the cooled rolls.</li>
<li>Enjoy! Or store in air tight container.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can also use floss to cut into slices. Place the cut rolls in the prepared pan. In bowl, mix brown sugar and cinnamon. In addition to their heavenly scent, Cinnabon cinnamon rolls are beloved for their jumbo size, fluffy texture, and thick layer of cream cheese frosting. Make Cinnabon's Copycat Cinnamon Rolls recipe up to the point where you cut the rolls and put them in the pan.</p>
