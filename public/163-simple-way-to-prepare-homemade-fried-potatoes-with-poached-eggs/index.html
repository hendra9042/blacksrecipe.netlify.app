This dish was made very much by my mother-in-law, only with potatoes. My contribution is to put an egg poached, because at home we really like this combination of potato and egg. Pour the eggs over the browned potatoes, strew with the scallion, and scramble until the eggs are just set, maybe a minute or so. Sprinkle the eggs and potatoes with the cheese and fresh herbs, remove the skillet from the heat, and let the whole shebang rest for a few minutes until the residual heat melts the cheese and finishes cooking the eggs.</p>
