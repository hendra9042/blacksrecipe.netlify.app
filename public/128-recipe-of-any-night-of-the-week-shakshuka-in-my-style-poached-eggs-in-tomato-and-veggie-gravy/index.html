<p>It is of Tunisian origin and is now popular in the Middle East and North-Africa. Here, shakshuka is Indianised by poaching the eggs in a spicy onion, tomato gravy. When you're maybe the egg farmers of Nova Scotia could answer this question because I'm always a little unsure if I'm baking in my recipe. calls for four eggs and one of my eggs is a double yolk. Is that do I stop at three eggs or do I stop at two plus my double yogurt or do I still crack Four eggs. You make a quick tomato sauce, you cook eggs in it and if you're us, sautee a little fresh spinach with garlic on the side.</p>
