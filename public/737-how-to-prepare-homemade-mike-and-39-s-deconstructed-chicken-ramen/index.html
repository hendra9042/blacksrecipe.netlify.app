<li>Make your dry broth. Add everything in the Dry Broth section, including your whole chicken breasts, to a large pot and boil for 45 minutes.</li>
<li>Pull out chicken breasts and allow them to rest covered until cooled. Let em' sweat. Continue slow boiling your broth. Then, thin slice your chicken making large rounds with your cuts. [see photo] Cover and leave on the counter in a cool spot. Do not refrigerate.</li>
<li>Boil eggs and slice your side vegetables. Including your cabbage. Leave all out on cool counter top. Gather your condiments as well. Try this quick recipe for perfect, easy to peel, boiled eggs every time!</li>
<li>At this point, you can fully drain your broth through a fine mesh strainer or leave as is. Either way, place hot broth in two deep bowls and cover. Leave what's left of your broth in the pot and add water. Add enough water to boil your Ramen noodles. Yes, your water will look a bit murky but the leftover broth is meant to season your noodles.</li>
<li>Bring water/broth to a boil and add noodles. Do not add oil or salt as there's plenty in the leftover broth already.</li>
<li>Boil as per manufactures directions. The noodles pictured are on a 4 minute boil. Less than one minute before your noodles are cooked, add your fresh cabbage and stir.</li>
<li>Quickly drain your noodles and cabbage and rinse in cold water until fully cooled and drained.</li>
<li>Place noodles on individual serving plates or on one large communal plate for all to feed from. Arrange chicken slices on plate as well.</li>
<li>Plate up your [halved] boiled eggs and vegetable sides on one large serving dish or on individual plates.</li>
<li>Reheat broth bowls in microwave as hot as you possibly can. You'll want your broth almost bubbling. Remember, your guests will be dipping cooled noodles and chicken, chilled vegetables and condiments in it and you'll want the heated temperature to last.</li>
<li>Have your guests place chicken slices in their bowls first to moisten them. [or cook them if you've chosen raw, thin sliced meats or seafood] Then have them add noodles, sides and condiments. Or, allow them pull noodles, meat or veggies directly from the serving plates one by one and dip before they eat.</li>
<li>Authors Notes: The bottom line to this dish is, make certain your broth is piping hot and everything else is  somewhat room temperature. Also, this dish can easily serve four.
