<h5 id="instructions-to-make-for-beginners-too---cream-amp-chocolate-rolls">Instructions to make For Beginners, Too - Cream &amp; Chocolate Rolls:</h5>
<ol>
<li>If you are kneading the dough by hand (since the first rising will be done with the microwave), make the cream before making the dough.</li>
<li>Bring the egg and butter to room temperature.</li>
<li>Strain the egg through a strainer. 20 g will be used for making the dough and the remaining amount will be used later.</li>
<li>If you are using a bread maker, put all of the ingredients into the compartment and turn the switch on!</li>
<li>Ok. Let's make the 2 variations of cream.</li>
<li>Please refer tofor making the custard cream.</li>
<li>So now it's time for the chocolate cream.</li>
<li>Combine all of the &quot;A&quot; ingredients. Sift and put into a heat-resistant bowl.</li>
<li>Microwave the &quot;B&quot; milk for 30 seconds at 1000W.</li>
<li>Add the &quot;B&quot; milk little by little to the bowl with the &quot;A&quot; ingredients, while continuously stirring.</li>
<li>Microwave Step 10 for 1 1/2 minutes at 1000W.</li>
<li>Remove and add in the &quot;C&quot; ingredients. Microwave for another 45 seconds at 1000W.</li>
<li>Remove from the microwave and stir well. Mix in the rum and it's done. You can place the bowl in ice water to help it cool.</li>
<li>Note: Both of the creams should be soft enough to roll up in the bread dough.</li>
<li>Once the bread maker has finished kneading the dough, check it with your finger! Coat your finger with flour and poke the dough. If the hole doesn't fill in, it's done rising!</li>
<li>If the hole fills in after poking, then it's not done rising. Leave it for another 5 minutes.</li>
<li>If the entire ball of dough whithers, it's a sign of too much rising. Since you can't go back and fix it, resign yourself to a not-so-good end result and continue on!</li>
<li>Use a scraper or something similar to remove the dough from the bread maker. Push the dough firmly with your fist to remove the gas.</li>
<li>Use a scale to precisely divide the dough into 6 portions. Use a scraper to cut the dough. Absolutely do not tear the dough.</li>
<li>Cover the dough with a damp towel or place it in a bread mat so that it doesn't dry out.</li>
<li>Release the gas by pushing from the center towards the edges of the dough. (Just enough to release the larger gas pockets is fine)</li>
<li>Roll them into neat balls. Keep rolling them around until the dough becomes somewhat sticky.</li>
<li>Tightly pinch the back to hold it together.</li>
<li>Once they have all been rolled into balls, cover with a damp towel and let them sit for 15 minutes.</li>
<li>Place them with the seam facing up and release the gas one more time. Use a rolling pin them out to the size of 2 scrapers.</li>
<li>For the custard cream version, top 1/3 of the dough with 1 tbsp of custard cream.</li>
<li>For the chocolate cream version, top with the chocolate cream.</li>
<li>Fold the dough over so that it covers the cream and pinch the edges together tightly so that they blend in!</li>
<li>Use a scraper to cut slices starting from the center. Cut about 5.</li>
<li>Fold the cut sections of dough over the cream covered section of dough.</li>
<li>Gently stretch out the cut sections of dough to pull over to the underside, and push them tightly so that the edges blend in.</li>
<li>Once they have all been shaped, let rise a second time in an oven preheated to 40°C.</li>
<li>POINT: If using a 2 layer oven, bake the dough and let it rise on the second rack. But if your oven is smaller and there's not a lot of space in between the layers, there's a possibility they will get stuck to the top rack.</li>
<li>After rising, they should plump up like in the picture.</li>
<li>Preheat the oven to 190°C for 12 minutes. Meanwhile, spread the leftover egg from making the dough over the surfaces.</li>
<li>Put them in the oven. The baking time will vary according to your oven, so adjust accordingly.</li>
<li>When they are removed from the oven, place on a cooling rack to cool and then they're done!</li>
