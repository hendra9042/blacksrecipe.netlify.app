<ol>
<li>Rinse the rice very well several times under running tap water until clear water runs through. This is very important and prevents the rice from becoming sticky. An excellent way to rinse the surface starch of rice.</li>
<li>Add the rinsed rice to the steel insert of the Instant Pot along with equal amounts of water, 1 tsp avocado oil or any neutral oil &amp; 1/2 tsp salt. This instantly flavors up the cooked rice &amp; the oil keeps the grains nice &amp; fluffy.</li>
<li>Close the lid of the Instant Pot, seal the Valve. Pressure Cook on HIGH for 3 minutes.</li>
<li>Once the pressure cooking cycle is over the Instant Pot will begin to beep. Wait for 10 minutes NATURAL PRESSURE RELEASE and than release the rest of the pressure manually by moving the valve from the sealing to the venting position.</li>
<li>Carefully open the lid of the pot and gently fluff the steamed Jasmine Rice with the help of a fork.</li>
<li>Immediately transfer the cooked rice into a bowl or a large plate allow it to cool down and than pop it in the fridge to chill it. In the meantime proceed with the rest of the recipe. Chilling the rice will help you make the best ever Hibachi fried Rice and keep the rice grains nice and fluffy.</li>
<li>Scramble the eggs - Set the Instant Pot on SAUTE and keep it on NORMAL. Add 3 tbsp oil into the steel insert of the Instant Pot.</li>

<li>Stir the eggs every now and than until they scramble into large chunks. Set aside the scrambled eggs. It’s very important to keep the scrambled egg pieces large. We’ll break them later.</li>
<li>Make the Hibachi Fried Rice - Before you begin assembling the Hibachi Fried Rice set the SAUTE function of your Instant Pot to NORMAL.</li>
<li>Now, add 3 tbsp oil. When the oil becomes moderately hot add the chopped onions and saute until the begin to become limp or translucent.</li>
<li>Next, add the thawed frozen veggies like diced carrots &amp; peas (read Notes below). Saute the veggies along with the sugar for about 2-3 mins for crisp tender veggies and saute a little longer for softer veggies. It’s upto you.</li>
