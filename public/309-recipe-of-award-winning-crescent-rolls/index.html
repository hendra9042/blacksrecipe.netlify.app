<h5 id="steps-to-make-crescent-rolls">Steps to make Crescent Rolls:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Start rolling from wide side to form the crescent shape. Make sure the pointed tip is stuck to the dough. (Optional-Cheese and salami/ham can be placed on the wide side of the roll and then rolled into crescent shape).</li>
<li>Measure flour accurately. Overfill the measuring cup loosely with flour. Tap it down and with a flat end of knife, cut it at the rim.</li>
<li>In a large mixing bowl, combine 1 cup of flour, yeast, sugar, salt, milk powder together. Give it a whisk.</li>
<li>Warm milk to temperature of 110-115 deg f (or when finger dipped in milk, should feel warm to touch). (I microwaved the milk for 1 minute and 10 seconds).</li>
<li>Combine oil/butter with milk. Add milk to the flour mixture and stir with wooden/silicone spatula. Add remaining flour 1/4 cup at a time till the dough comes together.</li>
<li>Add water little at a time if the mixture looks dry or still isn't formed as a dough. (Eyeball the water addition). The dough should be of shaggy consistency and soft.</li>
<li>Transfer the dough to flour dusted clean work surface. Knead the dough for 10-15 minutes till it's smooth.</li>
<li>Gather the dough in a round shape. Apply oil to the the dough and transfer it to a well oiled deep bowl to rest and rise for 1-1/2 hours.</li>
<li>Cover the bowl with cling film or kitchen napkin. Keep the bowl in a warm place to rise. (For colder climate, the dough may not rise sufficiently or it's very slow process. In that case, heat oven to lowest temperature for 10 minutes. Switch off the oven. Place the dough in the oven till it's risen).</li>
<li>Once the dough has doubled in size, punch it down gently and gather the dough together again.</li>
<li>Roll out the dough in a large rectangular shape. Cut it in half vertically and then cut them in equal sized triangles.</li>
<li>Start rolling from wide side to form the crescent shape. Make sure the pointed tip is stuck to the dough. (Optional&ndash;Cheese and salami/ham can be placed on the wide side of the roll and then rolled into crescent shape).</li>
<li>Line a baking tray or rectangular baking pan with ovenproof parchment paper.</li>
<li>Place the crescent rolls on the pan arranging them three in a row with at least 1-/2&quot; gap between them.</li>
<li>Again cover these rolls with clean kitchen napkin and leave them to rise for 45 minutes in a warm place (not oven).</li>
<li>Meanwhile preheat oven to 200 deg c (425 deg f). Brush these balls with the egg wash.</li>
<li>Bake for 15 minutes and remove from oven. Rest them for 5 minutes on the tray and then transfer to wire rack to cool.</li>
</ol>
<p>The crescent dog is easily one of the most-loved snacks (or dinner!) of our childhood. Unlike crescent rolls, croissants are not a yeast-based dough. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Place crescent rolls on the baking … Roll up into a crescent roll. Do the same with the other half of the dough.</p>
