Cabbage &amp; Steamed Fried Eggs is something which I have loved my entire life. They are nice and they look wonderful.</p>
<p>Cabbage (comprising several cultivars of Brassica oleracea) is a leafy green, red (purple), or white (pale green) biennial plant grown as an annual vegetable crop for its dense-leaved heads. It is descended from the wild cabbage (B. oleracea var. oleracea), and belongs to the &quot;cole crops&quot; or brassicas, meaning it is closely related to broccoli and cauliflower (var. botrytis); Brussels sprouts. This meat stuffed cabbage roll is baked and smothered in sweet and sour tomato sauce. Cabbage is a plant that is commonly eaten as a vegetable.</p>
<p>To get started with this recipe, we have to first prepare a few ingredients. You can cook cabbage &amp; steamed fried eggs using 4 ingredients and 5 steps. Here is how you cook that.</p>

<p>Red cabbage with apples is a traditional German side dish for pork roast and other roasts, Christmas goose, turkey, and game. It tastes even better when reheated so I usually make it the day before. It is a staple on most people's home for Christmas dinner. The humble cabbage may not seem like a superfood in the classic sense.</p>

<li>Mince the cabbage and vegetables. I used 20 g of carrots this time. Season the vegetables with salt and pepper.</li>
<li>Add the vegetables to a deep heat-resistant container, cover with a lid and microwave for 30 seconds.</li>
<li>Create a shallow well in the center and carefully place the egg on top. Use a toothpick to poke a hole in the egg yolk.</li>
<li>Flavor the egg with salt and pepper if desired, close with a lid and microwave for a minute to a minute and a half, and it's complete.</li>
<li>If you like your eggs stiff, then microwave the egg at the beginning with the vegetables.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is a staple on most people's home for Christmas dinner. The humble cabbage may not seem like a superfood in the classic sense. But this everyday vegetable is packed with vitamins C and K and folate, and boasts few calories and heaps of fiber. Cabbage is a good source of lutein and zeaxanthin, forms of vitamin A that are known to accumulate in the retina and be especially helpful for warding off vision damage. For people with diabetes, cruciferous vegetables like cabbage are an excellent choice.</p>
